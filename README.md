# Travel Insurance Claim Prediction
This project explores a dataset about a travel insurance company historical data to see whether if a policyholder/customer will issue their claim or not. 
This project aims to hone machine learning skills by dealing with an unknown dataset and predict the result of the data.
In this project, the programming language used is python written in jupyter notebook.

Here is the Framework for this project :

## Business Problem
This project starts with defining the problem for the travel insurance company continued by goals, analytical approach, and choosing appropriate metrics for the modeling.

## Data Understanding
In this section, the dataset is explored to understand what each feature stands for and what data can one row explains.

## Data Cleaning
This section focused on cleaning the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and data anomaly that can be found within the dataset.

## Data Analysis
This section explores on how each column correlates with the target of this prediction model.

## Data Preparation
This section contains the preparatory method for machine learning, which involves transforming columns into a certain value in order have the data ready for the machine learning models.

## Modeling
This section starts by training the model with train set using cross validation method in order to find the best model algorithm.

## Best Model
Best model obtained from the cross validation method will be tuned, then finally predict to test set, then check their confusion matrix, feature importance, and SHAP to interpret the model.

## Conclusion & Recommendation
This section will focuses on answering the business problem stated at the start of the notebook and also gives recommendation for business and for future works that can improve the model.
